This project demonstrates essential data analysis and visualization techniques using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The script loads a dataset, performs statistical analysis, calculates the average of a specific column, and visualizes the data using different types of plots.
The script reads a CSV file containing diabetes-related data from:C:\Users\dhara\Downloads\diabetes2.csv
Update the file path if necessary to match your local directory.
